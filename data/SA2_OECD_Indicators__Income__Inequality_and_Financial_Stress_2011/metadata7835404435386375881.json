Such estimates are derived from the application of microsimulation modeling techniques to microdata based on sample surveys and the Commonwealth Census. These estimates may be different from the actual characteristics of the population because of sampling and non-sampling errors in the microdata and because of the assumptions underlying the modeling techniques. The microdata do not contain any information that enables identification of the individuals or families to which they refer.","attribution":"{datasource.organisationTitle}, ({dataset.attributionYear}): {dataset.title}; accessed from AURIN Portal on {dateOfAccess}.<br><br>When using these data in published research, the authors need to include the following attribution in the text:<br>'These estimates are produced by NATSEM's Spatia Microsimulation model, which is described further in Tanton et al (2011)'<br><br>and the following in the bibliography:<br>Tanton, R., Vidyattama, Y., Nepal, B., & McNamara, J.

Leaving low income from benefit is the gross earning (expressed as a percentage of average full time earnings) required for a family to reach a 60% of median household income threshold from benefits of last resort (State welfare payments or income support).  All estimates were derived using a spatial microsimulation model which used the Survey of Income and Housing and the 2011 Census data as base datasets, so they are synthetic estimates.
